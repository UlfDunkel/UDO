!subnode Tips & tricks according to ST-Guide

!subsubnode A user-defined title page for ST-Guide
!ignore_links

If you don't like the layout of the title page UDO will make with
(!I)!/maketitle(!i) you can make your own title page with some commands:

The following example shows how to make your own title page but only for the
ST-Guide. It's used a ""hidden"" node that contains the word ""Contents"" at
the end. The ST-Guide will insert a link to the table of contents due to
this word.

!autoref [off]
!begin_quote
!vinclude examples/stg/title.u
!end_quote
!autoref [on]

!subsubnode Don't use justified text
!ignore_links

""Why that?"" you might ask. Well, Martin Osieka has written a program
called Hyperion for the Apple Macintosh that can display ST-Guide
hypertexts.

In contrast to ST-Guide Hyperion can display hypertexts with proportional
fonts but only if you don't use justified text.

Thus you should don't use the justification if you want that Macintosh users
shall also read your hypertext without any problems.

If you have written a system specific hypertext that is only interesting for
Atari users you can use justification without any doubts.

!subsubnode Lists
!alias xlist environment

Like the description environment this set of commands is useful to
describe words. Using this environment the description of each word
is displayed beneath one another.

The xlist environment starts with (!I)!/begin_xlist [!..](!i) and
finishes with (!I)!/end_xlist(!i). You have to tell UDO in brackets
how wide it should indent the descriptions of each item. Usually you
use the longest word in brackets. Each word that has to be described
has to used inside the brackets of the (!I)!/item~[~](!i) command.

You can use the xlist environment inside other (xlist) environments, too.

This short example!..

!autoref [off]

!begin_quote
!begin_verbatim
UDO offers you the following environments:
!begin_xlist [description environment:]
!item [itemize environment:]
      for itemizations
!item [enumerate environment:]
      for enumerations
!item [description environment:]
      for descriptions
!item [xlist environment:]
      for lists (discussed in this section)
!end_xlist
!end_verbatim
!end_quote

!.. will be displayed this way:

UDO offers you the following environments:
!begin_xlist [description environment:]
!item [itemize environment:]
      for itemizations
!item [enumerate environment:]
      for enumerations
!item [description environment:]
      for descriptions
!item [xlist environment:]
      for lists (discussed in this section)
!end_xlist

!autoref [on]

!smallskip

The command (!I)!/short(!i) can also be used for xlist environments. To get
a compressed list just add (!I)!/short(!i) at the end of the line that
contains (!I)!/begin_xlist(!i). Once more a short example:

!autoref [off]
!begin_quote
!begin_verbatim
!begin_xlist [description:] !short
!item [itemize:] Itemizations
!item [enumerate:] Enumerations
!item [description:] Descriptions
!item [xlist:] Lists
!end_xlist
!end_verbatim
!end_quote

!.. will be displayed this way:

!begin_xlist [description:] !short
!item [itemize:] Itemizations
!item [enumerate:] Enumerations
!item [description:] Descriptions
!item [xlist:] Lists
!end_xlist
!autoref [on]

!smallskip

!label blist environment
!label ilist environment
!label tlist environment

Since Release 6 UDO offers three additional environments that are familiar
with the xlist environment. In contrast to the xlist environment the items
will be displayed in bold, italic or typewritered text.

!begin_enumerate

!item	When using the blist environment (bold list) the items will be
displayed in bold text. A blist environment will be started with
(!I)!/begin_blist(!i) and finished with (!I)!/end_blist(!i).

!item	When using the ilist environment (italic list) the items will be
displayed in italic text. A blist environment will be started with
(!I)!/begin_ilist(!i) and finished with (!I)!/end_ilist(!i).

!item	When using the tlist environment (typewritered list) the items will be
displayed in typewritered text. A tlist environment will be started with
(!I)!/begin_tlist(!i) and finished with (!I)!/end_tlist(!i).


!end_enumerate

!smallskip

The following example shall demonstrate the results:

!begin_quote
!begin_verbatim
!begin_xlist [typewritered:]
!item [normal:] !..
!end_xlist

!begin_blist [typewritered:]
!item [bold:] !..
!end_blist

!begin_ilist [typewritered:]
!item [italic:] !..
!end_ilist

!begin_tlist [typewritered:]
!item [typewritered:] !..
!end_tlist
!end_verbatim
!end_quote

!.. will be displayed this way:

!begin_xlist [typewritered:]
!item [normal:] !..
!end_xlist

!begin_blist [typewritered:]
!item [bold:] !..
!end_blist

!begin_ilist [typewritered:]
!item [italic:] !..
!end_ilist

!begin_tlist [typewritered:]
!item [typewritered:] !..
!end_tlist

!smallskip

You have to notice some aspects:

!begin_enumerate

!item	If the text inside the brackets contains a ""]"" you have to quote
it with an exclamation mark so that UDO will recognize that this ""]"" shall
be part of the item and shall be displayed on the ""left side"".

!item	HTML, Linuxdoc-SGML and Texinfo don't support an environment like
UDO's xlist environment. In these formats the xlist environments are
displayed like a description environment by default. But if you use the
switch (!I)!/use_xlist(!i) inside the preamble UDO will print xlist
environments like in ASCII, but with preformatted text.

!item	UDO doesn't know the character widths when converting the source
file to RTF and Windows Help. If the indents are too wide you can adjust the
indent by using the commands (!I)!/rtf_charwidth(!i) and
(!I)!/win_charwidth(!i).

!item	A description of the (!I)!/short(!i) command is part of the chapter
""Itemizations"".

!end_enumerate

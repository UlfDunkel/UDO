After having extracted the archive that contains the Macintosh version of
UDO you can move UDO's files to any place of your file system you want to.
In most cases this would be the ""Programs"" directory.

UDO is available as a fat-binary so it will run both on a 68k Macintosh and
a PowerPC Macintosh. If you want to save some disk space you may be smaller
the program with a certain software.

If you have access to the hypertext of UDO (''(!V)UDO6GER.HYP(!v)'') you can
read it with ""Hyperion"". Hyperion is a software written by Martin Osieka
that can display ST-Guide hypertexts. When using Hyperion you should copy
''(!V)UDO.HYP(!v)'' to the Hyperion directory.

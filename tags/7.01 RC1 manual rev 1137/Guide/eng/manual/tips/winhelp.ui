!subnode Tips & tricks concerning Windows Help

!subsubnode Write the source files with a Windows editor
!ignore_links

You can speed up the conversion if you write the source files with a Windows
editor. In this case UDO doesn't have to convert the characters from the IBM
PC character set into the Windows ANSI character set.

If you write source file with a Windows Editor you have to insert the switch
(!I)!/code_iso(!i) inside the preamble of your source file. If you forget to
do this UDO will think that the source file was written with the IBM PC
character set.

Tip: I recommend to use the ""Programmer's File Editor"" (PFE) written by
Alan Phillips, a really great freeware editor that is available both for
Windows 3.11 and Windows95/NT.

!subsubnode Compress the Windows Help files
!ignore_links

Using the switch (!I)!/win_medium_compression(!i) or
(!I)!/win_high_compression(!i) you can tell the Microsoft Helpcompiler to
compress the final Windows Help file up to 50%. The Microsoft Helpcompiler
will need a little bit more time to convert the RTF source file if you use
the upper switches.

!item [(!DESCRIPTION)]
This command tests the current operating system UDO is running on. If
""<systems>"" doesn't match any of the abbreviations of the operating
systems UDO will convert all lines that follow (!KW [else]) if it
is used. If (!KW [else]) isn't used UDO will ignore all lines until
an (!KW [endif]). The example shows how you can test if UDO
does (!B)not(!b) run on an Apple Macintosh.

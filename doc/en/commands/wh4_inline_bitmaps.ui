!item [(!DESCRIPTION)]
If you use this switch inside the preamble of your source file UDO will
use the RTF tag ""(!code [\bmcwd])"" instead of ""(!code [\bmc])"" for
displaying images. In this case, the Microsoft Help Compiler stores
images in another format in the WinHelp4 file, which avoids skewed
images. Then you cannot use images larger than (!const [64])~KB. Please read the
(!file [HCP]) documentation to get more information about the differences between
these two RTF tags.

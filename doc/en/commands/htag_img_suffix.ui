!item [(!DESCRIPTION)]
UDO uses the suffix ""(!file [.tiff])"" when converting the image commands for
HP HelpTag SGML by default. If you want to use different image types
you can redefine the image suffix with this command. The
example below shows how to change the image suffix to ""(!file [.xwd])"". You can use
(!KW [htag_img_suffix]) as often as you want so you can redefine
the image suffix right before every image.

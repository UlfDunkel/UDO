!item [(!DESCRIPTION)]
When converting into (!LaTeX) UDO outputs (!KW [node]) as ""(!code [\chapter])"" instead of
""(!code [\section])"", (!KW [subnode]) as ""(!code [\section])"" instead of ""(!code [\subsection])"" and
(!KW [subsubnode]) as ""(!code [\subsection])"" instead of ""(!code [\subsubsection])"".
It then uses (!code [book]) as document style resp. document class. 
When converting to other formats a booklike output will be made, that
means that chapters will be printed as ""Chapter~#"" resp. ""Appendix~X:"".

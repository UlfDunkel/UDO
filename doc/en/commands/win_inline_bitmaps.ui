If you use this switch inside the preamble of your source file UDO
will use the RTF tag ""(!code [\bmcwd])"" instead of ""(!code [\bmc])""
for displaying images. In this case you cannot use images larger than
(!const [64])~KB. Please read the HCP documentation to get more information
about the differences between these two RTF tags.

!item [(!DESCRIPTION)]
Used in the preamble this command determines the default
alignment of tables that are included with the (!KW [begin_table]) command.
This alignment will be used when a table is placed outside
a center, flushleft or flushright environment.
When a table is placed inside such an environment,
it will be aligned according to the text of the environment,
independent of the setting of the (!KW [table_alignment]) command.
If you want to align a table right inside a center environment,
you will have to insert a flushright environment around
the (!KW [begin_table]) and (!KW [end_table]) commands.

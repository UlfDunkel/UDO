With this command you can test if a symbol was (!B)not(!b) set with
the command line option (!code [-D]) or with (!KW [set]). If
""(!TEXT)"" wasn't set UDO will convert all lines bewteen
(!KW [ifnset]) and (!KW [else]) or (!KW [endif]). If
""(!TEXT)"" was set UDO will convert all lines between
(!KW [else]) and (!KW [endif]) if (!KW [else]) was used. The
example shows how to test if the symbol ""british"" isn't set.

!begin_node Changes from Release 5 to 6
!html_name history_release_5_to_6

(!PUBLISHED [UDO~6] [on Jan 3, 1997])

You will find here a very compressed list of the major changes of the
last eight months. UDO supports now more destination formats, it
supports new features and there were fixed a lot of bugs. In some
cases it was impossible not to change the syntax of some commands.

!begin_description !compressed

!item [New destination formats:]
      !begin_itemize !compressed
      !item Apple QuickView
      !item HP-HelpTag-SGML
      !item LyX
      !item NROFF (!nl)
        I don't know if UDO really saves NROFF or if it is TROFF or GROFF.
        But you can already use it to make simple manpages for Unix systems.
      !item ""C source code"" and ""Pascal source code""
        Using these formats it is possible to edit a C or Pascal source
        code and its documentation in one file.

        UDO will print ""normal"" text using the comment characters of C
        or Pascal. The source code will be printed without conversion.

!item [News:]
      !begin_itemize !compressed
      !item You can use four layers now for structuring your text.
      !item Justification
      !item Macros and definitions can contain parameters. Thus, you can write your own commands in most cases.
      !item blist-, ilist- and tlist-environment
      !item right justified text (flushright environment)
      !item left justfied text (flushleft environment) for suppressing the justification
      !item You can use up to four email addresses on the title page now.
      !item UDO supports Italian ((!KW [language] [[italian!!]])), Spanish
            ((!KW [language] [[spanish!!]])) and Swedish
            ((!KW [language] [[swedish!!]])) now.
      !item UDO can sort the hyphen file and delete duplicates.
      !item (!KW [no_umlaute]) converts now all international characters, not only the German umlauts.
      !item The source code was optimized. Although UDO supports lots of new commands this version of UDO runs faster than the old one.
      !end_itemize

!item [Changes:]

      !begin_itemize !compressed
      !item The RTF output was programmed completely new. You can import UDO's RTF files without problems in WinWord.
      !item UDO saves a preamble for (!LaTeX)~2.09 and (!LaTeXe) on its own (you can switch it off, if you want).
      !item UDO allows you to use many more nodes, table rows, hyphens etc.
      !item UDO checks the source files more pedantically.
      !item Images are positioned like the outer text. To center an
            image you have to use the (!KW [image]) command inside a
            center environment. Thus, you can print left and right
            justified images, too.
      !item The suffix for ASCII files is now (!file [.txt]).
      !item UDO doesn't break line between (!code [\verb]) when converting to (!LaTeX).
      !item Graphic characters of the IBM PC character set will be replaced by ""(!code [+])"", ""(!code [-])"" and ""(!code [|])"" for Windows Help.
      !end_itemize

!item [Syntax changes:]

      !begin_itemize !compressed
      !item (!KW [no_verbatim_umlaute]) replaces the switch (!KW [verbatim_no_umlaute])
      !item The switch (!KW [list_parsep]) doesn't exist anymore.
            You can print ""compressed"" environment easier with (!KW [short]) now.
      !item The language of the destination file has to be set with the (!KW [language]) command now.
            (!KW [language] [[english!!]]) replaces the command (!KW [english]).
      !item You can pass three index entries with one (!KW [index]) command now.
      !item (!KW [win_html_look]) doesn't exist anymore.
      !item Shadowed, hollow, outlined and framed text isn't supported anymore. 
            But you can define your own commands with definitions if you need these text styles.

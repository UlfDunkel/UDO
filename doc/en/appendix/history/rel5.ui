			lines.

			new. Now you can use up to six environments inside
			another, the xlist environment, too! UDO generates a
			correct output for Windows Help and RTF.

			completely new.

	!item   UDO now references only complete words.

	!item   You can use 1024 chapters and 1024 labels now.

	!item   You can use up to 200 links inside a paragraph. Due to a
			bug you could only use 16 links inside a complete document
			in release 4.

	!item   Manualpages are layouted completely new.

	!item   Paintbrush PCX images are supported for em(!TeX).

	!item   The output of Windows Help was updated in many cases!

         This tag is extended to (!code [<ul class="content">]).
         Therefore you can choose, weather the bullets in front of
         every item should be drawn or not. You can control it by
         (!code [ul.content~{~list-style-type:~none;~}]) in a CSS file.
   !item (!KW [newpage]) will be converted to 
         (!code [<span style="page-break-after:always;"></span>]) for HTML output.
         So user agents who knows about it, can make a pge break.
   !item The image captions will be put out as a field for RTF output.
         Therefore a table of images could be created.
   !item There would be build a speacial page with a macro of a list of
         figures for the RTF output, even if (!KW [listoffigures])
         is set. The macro must be executed in the word processor.

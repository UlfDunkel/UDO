!begin_node GEM version
!html_name usage_gem

For GEM (Atari platforms) there is a graphical user interface (shell)
which is no longer maintained and supported. 
See (!url [http://www.udo-open-source.org/download/shells.php] []).

The GEM version enables you to set the files and options by simply
clicking the mouse. Furthermore you can define programs for editing
and viewing files that can be started by the GEM version.

The GEM version supports the VA protocoll, iconification and drag &
drop. It runs with every AES: TOS, MultiTOS, Geneva, MagiC (Mac/PC) or
STonX.

While converting you can see the current status of UDO. Because of the
AES calls the GEM version runs slower than the TTP version. If you
want to convert large source files I recommend to use the TTP version.

The usage of the GEM version is very easy.

!begin_node GEM main dialog
!html_name usage_gem_main

In the main dialog you can see several buttons and a menu bar. In the
main dialog you choose the source file, the destination file and the
destination format. By pressing the ""Convert"" button you start the
conversion.

!begin_center
!ifset [teTeX]
!raw [tex] \scalebox{0.9}{
!endif
!image (!IMAGES)gem_main
!ifset [teTeX]
!raw [tex] }
!endif
!end_center


The items of the menu bar open other dialogs in most cases. If not you
can guess the sense of them by simply reading the menu item text. Two
menu items have to be described:

!begin_tlist [Dest/Start program:]

!item	[Dest/Start program:] You can define a program for each
destination format. E.g. you can define a program that converts the
ST-Guide source files (made with UDO) into a ST-Guide hypertext, or a
program that converts the (!LaTeX) files into a DVI file.

!item	[Dest/ST-Guide:] If you choose this menu item UDO calls the
ST-Guide and tells it to display the converted hypertext (source file
name, suffix (!file [.hyp])).

!end_tlist

!begin_node GEM dialog ""Settings""
!html_name usage_gem_settings

After clicking the menu item ""Options, Settings"" this dialog
appears. The sense of each button you can see in this dialog will be
described now.

!begin_center
!ifset [teTeX]
!raw [tex] \scalebox{0.8}{
!endif
!image (!IMAGES)gem_opts
!ifset [teTeX]
!raw [tex] }
!endif
!end_center

!begin_itemize

!item	Destination file:

	!begin_itemize

	!item	Adjust: If this button is checked the GEM version will
	adjust the file name of the destination file when changing the
	destination format. How it is adjusted depends on the status of
	the following buttons:

		!begin_itemize

		!item	Completely: UDO adjusts the name completely.

		!item	Name and suffix: UDO takes the name of the source file
		and adjusts the suffix according to the current destination
		format. The path of the destination file isn't adjusted.

		!item	Only the suffix: UDO adjusts only the suffix of the
		destination file according to the current destination format.
		The path and the file name aren't adjusted.

		!end_itemize

	!item	View: If this button is checked UDO will call the
	destination viewer after having converted the source file.

	!end_itemize

!item	Ask before:

	!begin_itemize

	!item	Quitting UDO: If this button is checked UDO asks you
	before quitting it.

	!item	Overwriting file:If the destination file already exists
	UDO will ask if it should overwrite the file when starting the
	conversion.

	!end_itemize

!item	Options:

	!begin_itemize

	!item	Save log file: Shall UDO save a log file that contains all
	error messages, warning messages and additional information
	(similar to the command line option (!V)(--)no-logfile)(!v)?

	!item	Save hyphen file: Shall UDO save a hyphen file with
	hyphenation patterns
	(similar to the command line option (!V)(--)no-hypfile)(!v)?

	!item	Save tree file: Shall UDO save a tree file where you can
	see the include file structure of your documentation
	(similar to the command line option (!V)(--)treefile(!v))?

	!item	Verbose mode: Shall UDO display the status during the
	conversion
	(similar to the command line option (!V)(--)verbose(!v))?

	!item	Suppress warnings: Shall UDO suppress warning messages in
	the log file
	(similar to the command line option (!V)(--)no-warnings(!v))?

	!end_itemize

!begin_node GEM dialog ""Symbols""
!html_name usage_gem_symbols

The GEM version enables you to set predefined symbols when starting
the conversion. You can insert the text and choose which symbol has to
be used by clicking the buttons on the left side.

!begin_center
!image (!IMAGES)gem_syms
!end_center

If an entry is checked UDO will use the text as a predefined symbol.

!end_node

################################################################################

!begin_node GEM dialog ""External programs""
!html_name usage_gem_externalprograms

This dialog looks very complicated and I must say that I have to
change the design next time.

In this dialog you can define the programs you can use for editing and
viewing the source files and destination files or for converting the
destination files.

!begin_center
!ifset [teTeX]
!raw [tex] \scalebox{0.7}{
!endif
!image (!IMAGES)gem_prgs
!ifset [teTeX]
!raw [tex] }
!endif
!end_center

Please select the destination format in the upper half.

In the lower half you can choose the program. If this program isn't a
GEM application you should check the button ""TOS program"". If it is
a GEM application and it supports (!code [VA_START]) you should check
the ""Supports (!code [VA_START])"" button. These settings are only used
if UDO starts the programs itself. Finally you can edit the parameters
UDO shall use when calling the programs. You can use placeholders for
the name of the current source file and destination file. Click the
""Hint"" button to get more information.

!subsubsubheading How UDO starts programs

!begin_itemize

!item	In first place UDO will look for an AV server. If
(!code [AVSERVER]) is set inside the environment or Gemini or Thing are
running, UDO tells them to start the program.

!item	If there's no AV server available UDO starts the programs
itself.

	!begin_itemize

	!item	If the program is an accessory the parameters will be
	transferred via (!code [VA_START]).

	!item	If the program is already running and it supports
	(!code [VA_START]), UDO will send a (!code [VA_START]) message to this
	program.

	!item	In all other cases UDO will start GEM applications with
	(!code [shel_write(!)]) and TOS programs with (!code [Pexec(!)]).

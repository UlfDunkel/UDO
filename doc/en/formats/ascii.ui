!begin_node ASCII
!html_name format_asc

The ""ASCII"" output generates a single text file with ""plain"" text.

!subsubheading Specialities and useful hints
!begin_itemize !compressed
!item It is not possible to split the output into more than one single file (like HTML).

!item The paragraph width can be changed with the (!KW [parwidth]) command.
UDO uses a value of 70~characters by default.

!item Text styles like bold, italic or underlined are generated with the characters (!code [*]), (!code [/]) and
(!code [_]) (as common in the Usenet). (!nl)
Because of the existence of some print tools(!N)e.g. IdeaList for Atari~ST(!n)
and newsreaders knowing these text styles UDO doesn't count these special characters. Lines containing such formatting characters can become longer than the specified paragraph width. (!nl)
If you want to suppress the output of these characters you can use the
switch (!KW [no_effects] [[asc!!]]) inside the preamble.

!autoref [off]
!item UDO generates ASCII files using the actual system charset.
Running UDO under Windows, not the Windows-ANSI charset but the DOS charset will be used.
Opening an UDO-generated text file with an Windows editor, umlauts and other
special characters seems to wrong.
!autoref [on]

!item Using (!KW [no_umlaute] [[asc!!]]), you can switch off umlauts and special characters.

!begin_node Registration

The height of the shareware or upgrade fee depends on your status. How much
money you have to pay you will find in ""How much does UDO cost?"" and ""How
much do upgrades cost?"".

Users from Great Britain are recommended to register UDO via Denesh Bhabuta.
Users from Sweden are recommended to register UDO via Tom Thomasson.

The appropriate amount of money can be paid by sending a cheque, a
Eurocheque or cash or by transferring the amount of money to my bank
account.

If you really want to risk to send cash please send Deutsche Mark and insert
a black piece of paper into the envelope so nobody can look inside gets the
idea to steal the letter.

Please send cheques, Eurocheques or cash to:

Dirk Hagedorn	(!nl)
Asmecke 1		(!nl)
59846 Sundern	(!nl)
Germany
!end_quote

If you prefer transferring the money to my bank account use these data:

!begin_quote
!begin_xlist [Account number:] !compressed
!item [Account holder:]	Dirk Hagedorn
!item [Account number:]	3 561 164
!item [Bank:]			Sparkasse Arnsberg-Sundern, Germany
!item [Bank code:]		466 500 05
!end_xlist
!end_quote

In all cases please don't forget to send me

!begin_itemize !compressed
!item your name
!item your complete address
!item your email address (if available)
!item on which operating system(s) you want to use UDO
!end_itemize

After having received the money I will send you a bill and a personalized
keycode. With the keycode you can disable the limitations of the shareware
version.

!subsubheading Services for registered users

New releases of UDO are released two or three times per year at maximum.
Registered users are enabled to use current beta versions at any time.

Because UDO is available for many operating systems and I don't have so much
time to compile new release every time I change some things, new releases
will be published only if the number of changes is high enough.

For registered users after about two weeks updated versions are published.
In these version old bugs are fixed, new destination formats are presented
and wishes of registered users are considered if they may be realised.

Registered users can download these updates via modem or FTP or they can
order them by sending a formated floppy disk with a readdressed envelope and
2~DM for stamps.

It goes without saying that registered users will get gratis support via
via (e)mail. Questions of registered users will be answered as detailed as
possible.

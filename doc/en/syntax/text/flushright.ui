!begin_node Right justified text
!html_name style_justifiedright
!label flushright environment

Lines that are part of a flushright environment will be displayed right
justified if the destination format supports right justified text.

You can use the flushright environment inside other environments. You can also
use it inside another flushright environment, even this may be senseless.

If you use other environments inside a flushright environment they will be
layouted like in all other cases. Only when the flushright environment is the
active one text will be printed right justified.

If the following example isn't printed right justified the current
documentation format doesn't allow it to use right justified text.

(!EXAMPLE_BEFORE)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)flushright.ui
(!EXAMPLE_AFTER)
!include (!EXAMPLES)flushright.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

You see that UDO layouts paragraphs of a flushright environment, too. To
insert a manual line break use the (!KKW [nl]) command.

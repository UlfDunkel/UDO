!label enumerate environment

The enumerate environment is useful for lists where the items have to be
enumerated with numbers or letters. It is started with
(!KW [begin_enumerate]) and finished with (!KW [end_enumerate]). Each
item has to be marked with (!KW [item]).

You can use the itemize environment inside other environments or inside
another itemize environment.

This short example shows how to write a simple itemize environment:

(!EXAMPLE_BEFORE)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)enumerate1.ui
(!EXAMPLE_AFTER)
!include (!EXAMPLES)enumerate1.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

In the following example the enumerate environment is used twice and it will
be compressed because of the usage of (!KW [compressed]):

(!EXAMPLE_BEFORE)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)enumerate2.ui
(!EXAMPLE_AFTER)
!include (!EXAMPLES)enumerate2.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

(!HINTS)

!begin_enumerate

!item   UDO doesn't enumerate the items for all destination formats. E.g.
HTML and (!LaTeX) enumerate the items themselves so you have to be cautious
with using text like ""see item 1"" or ""see point b)"".

!item   The third layer of enumerate environments will be indented deeper
than the other layers because Roman numbers need a little bit more space.

!item   Because the second layer is enumerated with letters you shouldn't
use more than (!const [26]) items.

!item   A description of the (!KW [compressed]) command is part of the chapter
""Itemizations"".

!end_enumerate

!end_node

!begin_node Lists
!html_name style_lists
!label xlist environment

Like the description environment this set of commands is useful to
describe words. Using this environment the description of each word
is displayed beneath one another.

The xlist environment starts with (!KW [begin_xlist]) and
finishes with (!KW [end_xlist]). You have to tell UDO in brackets
how wide it should indent the descriptions of each item. Usually you
use the longest word in brackets. Each word that has to be described
has to used inside the brackets of the (!KW [item]) command.

You can use the xlist environment inside other (xlist) environments, too.

(!EXAMPLE_BEFORE)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)xlist1.ui
(!EXAMPLE_AFTER)
!include (!EXAMPLES)xlist1.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

The command (!KW [compressed]) can also be used for xlist environments. To get
a compressed list just add (!KW [compressed]) at the end of the line that
contains (!KW [begin_xlist]). Once more a short example:

(!EXAMPLE_BEFORE)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)xlist2.ui
(!EXAMPLE_AFTER)
!include (!EXAMPLES)xlist2.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)


!label blist environment
!label ilist environment
!label tlist environment
Since Release 6 UDO offers three additional environments that are similar
to the xlist environment. In contrast to the xlist environment the items
will be displayed in bold, italic or typewritered text.

!begin_enumerate

!item   When using the blist environment (bold list) the items will be
displayed in bold text. A blist environment will be started with
(!KW [begin_blist]) and finished with (!KW [end_blist]).

!item   When using the ilist environment (italic list) the items will be
displayed in italic text. A blist environment will be started with
(!KW [begin_ilist]) and finished with (!KW [end_ilist]).

!item   When using the tlist environment (typewritered list) the items will be
displayed in typewritered text. A tlist environment will be started with
(!KW [begin_tlist]) and finished with (!KW [end_tlist]).

!end_enumerate

The following example shall demonstrate the results:

(!EXAMPLE_BEFORE)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)xlist3.ui
(!EXAMPLE_AFTER)
!include (!EXAMPLES)xlist3.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

You have to notice some aspects:

!begin_enumerate !compressed

!item   If the text inside the brackets contains a ""]"" you have to quote
it with an exclamation mark so that UDO will recognize that this ""]"" shall
be part of the item and shall be displayed on the ""left side"".

!item When the last character is an exclamation mark, a ""/"" has to follow 
or UDO would protect the closing bracket instead of outputting an exclamation mark.

!index (!kw [html_no_xlist])
!item HTML output creates tables for these lists. 
If you don't want table output for any reasons, you can advise UDO 
to output these lists as description environments, 
using the command (!KW [html_no_xlist]).

!item   Linuxdoc-SGML and Texinfo don't support an environment like
UDO's xlist environment. In these formats the xlist environments are
displayed like a description environment by default. But if you use the
switch (!KW [use_xlist]) inside the preamble UDO will print xlist
environments like in ASCII, but with preformatted text.

!item   UDO doesn't know the character widths when converting the source
file to RTF and Windows Help. If the indents are too wide you can adjust the
indent by using the commands (!KW [rtf_charwidth]) and
(!KW [win_charwidth]).

!item   A description of the (!KW [compressed]) command is part of the chapter
""Itemizations"".

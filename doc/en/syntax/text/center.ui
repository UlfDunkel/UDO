!begin_node Centered text
!html_name style_centered
!label center environment

Lines that are part of a center environment will be displayed centred if
the destination format can display centered text.

You can use the center environment inside other environments. You can also
use it inside another center environment, even if this may be senseless.

If you use other environments inside a center environment they will be
layouted like in all other cases. Only when the center environment is the
active one text will be printed centered.

If the following example isn't centered the current documentation format
doesn't allow it to use centered text.

(!EXAMPLE_BEFORE)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)center.ui
(!EXAMPLE_AFTER)
!include (!EXAMPLES)center.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

You see that UDO layouts paragraphs of a center environment, too. To insert
a manual line break use the (!KKW [nl]) command.

!end_node

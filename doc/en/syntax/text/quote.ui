!begin_node Indented paragraphs
!html_name style_indentations
!label quote environment

To display indented paragraphs you can use the quote environment which is
started with (!KW [begin_quote]) and finished with (!KW [end_quote]).
You can use the quote environment inside another quote environment or inside
other environments.

This environment is useful to emphasize passages. This effect is used in the
following example:

(!EXAMPLE_BEFORE)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)quote.ui
(!EXAMPLE_AFTER)
!include (!EXAMPLES)quote.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

(!HINT)

When converting to HTML the tag (!V)<BLOCKQUOTE>(!v) is used. Netscape
and CAB(!N)A web browser for Atari(!n) display paragraphs indented but
Mosaic displays them just with another font.

!end_node

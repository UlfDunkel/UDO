!begin_node Text styles
!html_name style_textstyles

UDO enables you to set text styles right inside the source file.

!include (!EXAMPLES)effects.ui

If you want to display a single word or some words in a certain text style
you have to use them between the according placeholders. Look, how the upper
paragraph was made:

!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)effects.ui

In this table you will see in which way the placeholders will be replaced:

!include syntax/text/styles.ui

!index (!kw [no_effects])
As you see here for the ASCII format there will be used the text style
commands as they are used in Usenet. If you don't like them you can use the
switch called (!KW [no_effects]) to suppress them. Use
(!KW [no_effects] [[asc!!]]) to suppress the text style commands when
converting to ASCII.

(!HINT)

Definitions are great for programming user-defined text styles. It is
for sure that you need some knowledge about the destination forma to do
this. The following example shows how to use ghosted text which is available
for the ST-Guide:

(!EXAMPLE_BEGIN)
!begin_verbatim
!ifdest [stg]
  !define G @{G}
  !define g @{g}
!else
  !define G
  !define g
!endif

Normal and (!G)ghosted(!g).
!end_verbatim
(!EXAMPLE_END)

!end_node

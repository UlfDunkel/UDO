!label linedraw environment

Normally UDO will replace all DOS graphic characters by the ASCII characters
""(!code [+])"", ""(!code [-])"" and ""(!code [|])"". So including DOS screenshots is not possible.

To display DOS screenshots you can use the linedraw environment,
which is started with (!KW [begin_linedraw]) and finished with
(!KW [end_linedraw]).

No UDO commands(!N)except
(!KW [end_linedraw])(!n) or placeholders will be converted. Text
inside this environment will be indented like normal text.

When converting into RTF, the font ""(!url [MS Linedraw] [http://www.kostis.net/charsets/mslinedr.htm] [] [elink])""
will be used, other formats will use the DOS character set.
When converting into (!LaTeX) the commands of UDO will be just
replaced by the (!LaTeX) commands (!code [\begin{verbatim}]) and
(!code [\end{verbatim}]). When converting to another format UDO adjusts
special chars and displays the text with a non-proportional font.

!index (!kw [tabwidth])
If the lines of the linedraw environment contain tabs (ASCII~9) UDO will
replace them by spaces according to the (!KW [tabwidth]) setting.

!index (!kw [ldinclude])
Because no commands inside a verbatim environment are noticed you
cannot use the (!KW [include]) command inside this environment.

To enable you to include an external file and display it as it would
be inside a linedraw environment UDO offers you the command
(!KW [ldinclude]). This command is a mixture of
(!KW [begin_linedraw]), (!KW [include]) and
(!KW [end_linedraw]).

(!HINT)

!begin_enumerate

!item   Because the text of a linedraw environment is indented like
normal text you shouldn't use extra spaces at the beginning of each
line.

!begin_ignore
!item Word for Windows displays the graphics correctly,
whereas WordPad95 does not.
!end_ignore

!end_enumerate

!end_node

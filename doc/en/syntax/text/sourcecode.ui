!begin_node Source code
!html_name style_sourcecode
!label sourcecode environment

Lines that are part of a sourcecode environment
will be displayed without conversion when converting
to one of the source code formats. 
When converting to one of the other destination formats,
these lines will be displayed like being part of 
a verbatim environment inside a quote environment.

A small example for a C source code with UDO:

(!EXAMPLE_BEGIN)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)csource.u
(!EXAMPLE_END)

Another possibility to include source code
is offered by the command (!KW [sinclude]).

!end_node

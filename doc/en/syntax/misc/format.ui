!begin_node Format-specific commands
!html_name misc_commands_format_specific
!label Special commands

UDO offers you the (!KW [raw]) command and the raw environment to insert
special commands for a specific format. So you are able to insert small
passages or huge blocks written in the destination format (like special
tables for (!LaTeX) or HTML).

You have to use abbreviations of the destination formates if you want
to use the (!KW [raw]) command:

!label Abbreviations
!include syntax/misc/short_dest.ui

The next example shows how to insert a line that will only be printed
for the ASCII format:

(!EXAMPLE_BEGIN)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)asc1.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

The next example shows how to insert a line that appears in all formats
except ASCII:

(!EXAMPLE_BEGIN)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)asc2.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

The contents of the line will be printed without the command and
without converting the text of the line. These commands split up text
into different paragraphs like all the other UDO commands. So these
commands aren't useful to insert a line into a paragraph!

You can use these commands to insert special commands like parts of
the preamble for (!LaTeX):

(!EXAMPLE_BEGIN)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)latex/index.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

!begin_description

!label raw environment
!index !begin_raw
!index !end_raw
!item [The raw environment]
But it happens that you want to insert large passages only for one
format with special commands. You could add one of the upper commands
at the beginning of each line, sure. But to make it easier for you to insert
these passages UDO has a special environment for this case: the raw
environment.

Together with the possibility to check the current destination format you
can e.g. insert complex tables for (!LaTeX) or forms for HTML with the raw
environment. The following example shows how to enter HTML forms to your
source code:

!index HTML !! <form>
!index <form>
(!EXAMPLE_BEGIN)
!vinclude (!EXAMPLES)raw1.ui
(!EXAMPLE_END)

To say it once more: Text that is part of a raw environment is printed ""as
is"". That means that it is not converted and not indented. If you will
insert the upper form source code into a verbatim environment you will
see the source code in an HTML browser. But if you insert it inside a raw
environment you will see the form!

Another choice you have is to use the command (!KW [rinclude]).

!label comment environment
!item [The comment environment]

If you want to write larger blocks in the output file as comments,
it would be troublesome to start each line with a command.

!index !begin_comment
!index !end_comment
Therefore UDO offers the "comment environment". It will be started with the
command (!KW [begin_comment]) and ends with the command (!KW [end_comment]).

As with the text of lines that start with the (!KW [comment]) command,
UDO will write text inside this environment as comment to the destination
file without converting special chars.

Another choice you have is to use the command (!KW [cinclude]).

!end_description

!end_node

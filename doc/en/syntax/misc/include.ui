UDO offers you the commands (!KW [include]), (!KW [input]), (!KW [vinclude]) and
(!KW [rinclude]). With these commands you are enabled to split up a
document into many files that are included by a main file. Furthermore
you can use these commands to include an often used passage that you
have to type only once.

This documentation uses this commands intensively. The file
(!file [udo.u]) doesn't contain any text and just includes other files.
So I have the possibility to find some passages more fast if I have to
change the documentation.

You can use (!KW [include]) wherever you want. So you can define macros,
definitions or hyphenation patterns in external files that can be used
by other files, too.

For displaying the preformatted contents of a file you can use the
(!KW [vinclude]) command (""verbatim include""). You can use this
command e.g. for displaying source files or header files.

If you want to include special commands for a destination format like
difficult tables for (!LaTeX) or HTML you can use the
(!KW [rinclude]) command (""raw include"").

(!B)Possible examples of use:(!b)

!begin_enumerate

!item   When writing large source files you can edit a separate file for
each chapter that are included by a main file with (!KW [include]). Thus
you can restructure your text by simply moving one line of the main file.

!item   If you split up your text into several file that are included by a
main file you can speed up looking for errors because you can simply switch
off some parts of the text by commenting out one line of the main file.

!item   Together with macros you can write standardized texts that you can
use for many projects. E.g. you can edit a standard disclaimer where the
name of the software is replaced by macros that are defined by the main
file.

!item   A documentation can be written by different persons. Each author can
test his own file with UDO. If everybody has finished his work all files
will be included by a main file.

!index (!kw [tabwidth])

!item   With (!KW [vinclude]) and (!KW [tabwidth]) you can add source
code to your documentation. This is great for a documentation of a source
code or a library.

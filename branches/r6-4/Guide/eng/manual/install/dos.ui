!subnode Installing the DOS version
!ignore_links

You need a 80386 processor at least to run UDO. UDO doesn't run on
80286 processors or processors of an older type and I won't compile versions for these old
dinosaurs.

If you find a program or batch file named (!V)SETUP(!v) or (!V)INSTALL(!v)
in the archive please start it and follow the instructions. If the
installation fails, please go on reading this chapter.

It failed? Ah, you haven't tested it yet? That's fine that you want to
read all the text before you want to experiment. (!grin)

Unfortunately the installation of the DOS version is not trivial. Er,
I think it is trivial but the experiences of the past have shown me
that lots of people have problems installing UDO on a DOS PC although the
installation is very simple.

If you haven't heard anything of RSX and EMXRT until now I recommend
to read the following two chapters completely. If UDO still
refuses to run you have done something wrong or I haven't described
the installation process detailed enough.

If you already know what RSX and EMXRT are good for, because you are using emTeX or
the GNU utilities) you can skip the next chapter.

!subsubnode Installation of RSX and EMXRT
!ignore_links

OK, you haven't heard anything of RSX and EMXRT yet.  That's not a
shame. But if you won't know what RSX and EMXRT are good for after
having read this chapter, you should feel ashamed. And if some RSX or
EMXRT experts recognize some stupid stuff I should feel ashamed.

Well, let's go!..

UDO was compiled with the GNU C Compiler (GCC), strictly speaking with
EMX-GCC (ported by Eberhard Mattes). GCC is originally a Unix software
and Unix has always used 32 bit software. Thus, the EMX-GCC makes 32
bit software, too. And now we have a problem, because you cannot run
32 bit software with DOS without using any tricks.

EMXRT and RSX are responsible for these tricks. These ""drivers""
allow UDO to allocate huge blocks of memory. Because you have to use
different tricks for DOS and Windows there are existing two different
""drivers"": EMXRT for DOS and OS/2, RSX for Windows.

Please note:

!begin_itemize

!item	For running UDO exclusively in a DOS box with Windows 3.11/95
you will need only RSX. RSX, written by Rainer Schnitker, is a DPMI
server for programs that were compiled with EMX-GCC or DJGPP.

!item	For running UDO under OS/2 or exclusively under DOS (without
Windows) you will need only EMXRT. EMXRT (""emx runtime
environment""), written by Eberhard Mattes, is needed for running
EMX-GCC compiled software.

!item	If you don't install neither RSX nor EMXRT there will be no
chance to run UDO. It will simply print an error message.

!item	The installation of RSX and EMXRT is very easy. Just extract
the archives with paths and enter two lines into the
(!V)AUTOEXEC.BAT(!v).

!item	RSX and EMXRT are no resident drivers. UDO will start them
automatically. After UDO has finished the drivers terminate, too.

!item	If you haven't received the drivers (you haven't
(!V)EMXRT.ZIP(!v) or (!V)DPMIGCC5.ZIP(!v)/(!V)RSX503RT.ZIP(!v)) and
the UDO distribution doesn't contain the archives you can download
them or you can request them by mail:

	!begin_xlist [Modem:] !short
	
	!item [FTP:] Current version of EMXRT can be downloaded from
	(!V)ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/systems/os2/emx-0.9b/(!v)
	
	Current versions of RSX can be downloaded from:
	(!V)ftp.uni-bielefeld.de/pub/systems/msdos/misc/(!v)

	!item [Modem:] You can download the files from the BBS called
	""Maus MK2 Iserlohn-Kalthof"" (+49 2371 944925) from the
	""Gruppenprogrammteil UDO.PUB"".
	
	!item [Mail:] Just send me a formatted floppy disk and a
	readdressed envelope and 2~DM (or a convertible amount of money)
	for postage.
	
	!end_xlist

!end_itemize

Let's talk about the installtion of RSX and EMXRT. Of course, you can
install only one of the drivers if you run exclusively DOS or Windows.
The following descriptions tells you how to install both drivers.

In first place you have to extract the archives. Stop! It's importand
that you extract the archives with paths! If you don't let your
archiver generate paths nothing will function. I recommend to use
(!V)UNZIP.EXE(!v). If you extract the RSX archive a directory ''(!V)RSX\(!v)''
will be saved. If you extract EMXRT a directory ''(!V)EMX\(!v)'' will
be saved. If you don't find these directories something went wrong.

You can move the directories to any position of your file system. I
recommend to move them to ''(!V)C:\DRIVERS(!v)''. If this directory
doesn't exist you have to create one.

After having extracted the archives you have to edit your
(!V)AUTOEXEC.BAT(!v) and to insert the following lines. If you have
only installed EMXRT, insert the lines below ""Only EMXRT"" and so on:

!begin_itemize

!item	Only EMXRT:

!begin_verbatim
SET EMX=C:\DRIVERS\EMX\BIN\EMX.EXE
!end_verbatim

!item	EMXRT and RSX:

!begin_verbatim
SET EMX=C:\DRIVERS\EMX\BIN\EMX.EXE
SET RSX=C:\DRIVERS\RSX\BIN\RSX.EXE
!end_verbatim

!item	Only RSX:

!begin_verbatim
SET EMX=C:\DRIVERS\RSX\BIN\RSX.EXE
SET RSX=C:\DRIVERS\RSX\BIN\RSX.EXE
!end_verbatim

!end_itemize

If RSX and EMXRT haven't been installed in ''(!V)C:\DRIVERS(!v)'' you
have to adjust the upper paths.

I think you already know that changes of the (!V)AUTOEXEC.BAT(!v)
are activated when rebooting your computer. Before you reboot your
computer I just want to summarize what you have done until now: you
have installed some files and you have inserted one or two lines into
your (!V)AUTOEXEC.BAT(!v). That's all.

And now, reboot your computer.

#-----------------------------------------------------------
!subsubnode Installation of (!T)UDO386.EXE(!t)

Let's talk of the easier part of the installation of UDO. The abridged
version: extract the archive and add the UDO directory to (!V)PATH(!v)
of your (!V)AUTOEXEC.BAT(!v).

But once more I will describe you the installation step by step:

!begin_enumerate

!item	Extract the UDO archvie (!B)with(!b) paths. If you won't find
a directory named ''(!V)UDO\(!v)'' something went wrong. If you will
find it move the directory named ''(!V)UDO\(!v)'' to any position of
your file system. The following descriptions assume that you move
''(!V)UDO\(!v)'' to your root directory.

!item	Now you have to let DOS find the executable:

	!begin_enumerate
	
	!item	Edit the (!V)AUTOEXEC.BAT(!v) and insert the following
	line:
	
!begin_verbatim
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\UDO\BIN
!end_verbatim

	This meand that DOS and Windows will look for
	''(!V)UDO386.EXE(!v)'' in this directory, too, when you have
	rebootet your computer.

	!item	If you don't like to extend your (!V)PATH(!v) you can move
	the executables of ''(!V)C:\UDO\BIN(!v)'' to any directory that's
	already listet in (!V)PATH(!v). Using this method you don't have
	to reboot your computer.

	!end_enumerate

!end_enumerate

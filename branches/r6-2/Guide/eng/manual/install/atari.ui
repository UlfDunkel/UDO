!subnode Installing the Atari version
!ignore_links

To install UDO onto an Atari or onto a computer with a compatible operating
system (e.g. MagiCMac, MagiC-PC, GEMulator) just copy all files to a
directory that should be named ""UDO"".

The GEM version should be the application for files with the suffix
''(!V)*.u*(!v)'' so you shall do the neccessary changes in your desktop
(Gemini, Thing, Ease, Magxdesk, !..).

If you prefer the TTP version and you are using a command line shell (e.g.
Mupfel by Stefan Eissing) copy or move ''(!V)udo.ttp(!v)'' to one of the
directories that is part of (!T)$PATH(!t) (e.g. ''(!V)\usr\bin(!v)'').

If you have installed the ST-Guide you should copy or move UDO's hypertext
((!V)udo6eng.hyp(!v) and (!V)udo6eng.ref(!v)) to the directory that contains
all your other hypertexts.

That's all.

!subnode Questions concerning Linuxdoc-SGML
!ignore_links

In March 1996 I found an article in the German Unix magazine ""iX"" about
Linuxdoc-SGML. It took two hours to download the Linuxdoc-SGML archive and
to implement this format into UDO. Unfortunately I didn't own a Linux
computer and so I wasn't able to test UDO's output.

Linuxdoc-SGML is a multiformat converter like UDO. With Linuxdoc-SGML you
can convert SGML files into (!LaTeX), RTF, HTML, Texinfo and manpages. But
it's not a lie if I say that UDO is more powerful than Linuxdoc-SGML 1.5.

Linuxdoc-SGML doesn't offer an environment like UDO's xlist environment. So
UDO is forced to handle it like a description environment.

Add the following line to (!V)/usr/lib/linuxdoc-sgml/rep/html/general(!v):

<!entity Aring sdata "&Aring;" >

!begin_description

!item	[Text styles inside indices:]
Inside indices you cannot use text styles at the moment. You can avoid this
problem of you use the text style commands outside the (!I)(!/idx~!..)(!i)
placeholder.
		
!item	[Images & em(!TeX):]
The output of (!LaTeX) commands for displaying MSP and PCX images with
em(!TeX) wasn't tested enough. If you have problems printing the images use
the switch (!I)!/no_images~[tex](!i) inside the preamble and write your own
commands inside a raw environment.

!item	[Small mistakes when layouting WinHelp:]
If you use many chapters and the chapter numbers become ""too wide"" there
may be wrong indents in the tables of contents. You can avoid this by using
the switch (!I)!/no_numbers~[win](!i) in the preamble.

!item	[Tables of contents:]
In the tables of contents long chapter titles aren't sized to the current
document width yet. Chapter titles may also appear in different columns
(""1.9""-""1.10"" problem).

/* Lookup a locale dependent file.
   *L10NFILE_LIST denotes a pool of lookup results of locale dependent
   files of the same kind, sorted in decreasing order of ->filename.
   DIRLIST and DIRLIST_LEN are an argz list of directories in which to
   look, containing at least one directory (i.e. DIRLIST_LEN > 0).
   MASK, LANGUAGE, TERRITORY, CODESET, NORMALIZED_CODESET, MODIFIER
   are the pieces of the locale name, as produced by _rc_explode_name().
   FILENAME is the filename suffix.
   The return value is the lookup result, either found in *L10NFILE_LIST,
   or - if DO_ALLOCATE is nonzero - freshly allocated, or possibly NULL.
   If the return value is non-NULL, it is added to *L10NFILE_LIST, and
   its ->next field denotes the chaining inside *L10NFILE_LIST, and
   furthermore its ->successor[] field contains a list of other lookup
   results from which this lookup result inherits.  */

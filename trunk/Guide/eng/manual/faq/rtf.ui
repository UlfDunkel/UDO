!subnode Questions concerning the Rich Text Format
!ignore_links

The Rich Text Format (RTF) is used for the system wide exchange of text
files. This format has a strict definition. New commands can be added every
time. If a RTF software reads in an unknown command it has to ignore it.

Unfortunately not all the existing software ignore unknown RTF commands,
some are interpreting some senseless stuff. Microsoft Word doesn't
interpret the RTF correctly in all cases, even if Microsoft has developed
the Rich Text Format.

It's not wrong if I say that RTF is the most misinterpreted format ever
known.

!item [Why doesn't UDO print a table of contents?] ~

I think you are the reader of your documentation wants to print it out with
a text processor. And it's for sure that you want the correct page numbers
inside the table of contents.

But UDO cannot know on which page a chapter will be printed. Thus it doesn't
print a table of contents when converting to RTF.

OK, it wouldn't be a problem to print it but I think you don't want a table
of contents without page numbers.

!item [Why doesn't UDO include the image data into the RTF file?] ~

Because I don't know until today how image data is converted into RTF data.
If you can tell me how this is done, please tell it to me.

!item [The output of my text processor is horrible, why?] ~

Bad luck. You own a text processor that cannot import RTF correctly. UDO
strictly pays attention to the RTF definition. If it's possible for you to
contact the authors of your text processor send them your RTF file.

By the way: I also tried to get contact to authors of text processors but
only one author (Christian Nieber, R.O.M. logicware, Papyrus) answered my
emails. Can you imagine that?

!item [8-bit characters aren't imported correctly!?] ~

UDO saves RTF files that use the Windows ANSI character set. Every text
processor should be able to import RTF files that use the IBM-PC
character set, the Macintosh character set and the Windows ANSI character set.
If some 8-bit characters are displayed incorrectly it's a problem of your
text processor and not a bug of UDO.


##################################################

!item [Quotes aren't imported correctly, why?] ~

UDO uses the RTF commands (!V)\lquote(!v), (!V)\rquote(!v),
(!V)\rdblquote(!v) and (!V)\ldblquote(!v) for displaying the typographical
quotes and apostrophes. Your text processor has to know these common RTF
commands.

If it doesn't want to import these RTF commands or the quotes and
apostrophes are displayed incorrectly you can tell UDO not to use these RTF
commands by inserting the switch (!I)!/no_quotes~[rtf](!i) inside the
preamble of the UDO source file.

##################################################

!item [My text processor cannot import tables. What can I do?] ~

Use the switch (!I)!/rtf_ascii_tables(!i) inside the preamble of your UDO
source file to tell UDO that it shall print tables without RTF commands like
in the ASCII format.

!item [StarWriter 3.0 prints an RTF error!?] ~

It seems to be that StarWriter 3.0 doesn't know all RTF commands and
furthermore it faults correct RTF commands. Please contact Star Division.

##################################################
!item [Indices aren't imported into StarWriter!?] ~

StarWriter 3.0 ignores the RTF command ''(!V)\xe(!v)'' which is used for
indices.

!item [Lotus WordPro places chapter numbers outside the text frame!?] ~

I'm sorry but I have no idea why it does this. Other text processors display
the chapter numbers correctly.

##################################################
!item [Lotus WordPro doesn't display tables correctly!?] ~

I don't know why Lotus WordPro doesn't recognize the ending of a table. The
table itself will be displayed incorrectly, too. Please use the switch
(!I)!/rtf_ascii_tables(!i) inside the preamble of your UDO source file.

##################################################
!item [WordPad doesn't display tables, why?] ~

Because WordPad cannot display tables. Use the switch
(!I)!/rtf_ascii_tables(!i) inside the preamble of your UDO source file.
